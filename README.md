# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett-Hackard has a large number of employees from the Baby Boomer Generation.  As these employees approach retirement age, Pewlett-Hackard expects they will need to fill thousands of job openings these Boomers will be leaving behind.  In order to combat decreases in productivity, we have been asked to perform an analysis on PH's employees and determine the number of employees retiring per job title as well as identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program.  These numbers could prove crucial in preparing for the approaching "silver tsunami."

## Results

There are a few takeaways that Pewlett_Hackard should be aware of and try to act upon immediately:

- Senior level employees will be the most impacted
  - There are 90,398 current employees retiring soon.  Of those ~90K, 57,668 of have Senior in their Title.

  Pewlett-Hackard must start looking internally or externally for qualified candidates to fill these senior positions.
